<p class="memorial"><b>Living Master</b><br><br>From Wikipedia: "Living Master is a term which distinguishes a living spiritual teacher from one who has already left his physical form (i.e., died.)"<br><br>I have only known Alex for a year and a half. In all the short time that I have known him, I was always greeted with a hearty squeal and an outburst of happiness that was borderline scary. At times, the greeting was followed by the demonstration of a second bellybutton. The one left behind by the feeding tube at the time when he was not able to eat.<br><br>At the time of our first meeting Alex was entirely bald from treatment and would adequately pass for a miniature Buddhist monk. Perhaps for a Yoda, in a weaker light.<br><br>Although his lookalikeness could have been interpreted in various ways his teaching was unmistakable. To me, it said and more importantly showed:  "I am a little boy with sorts of problems that you have not seen in your worst nightmares. Yet I am the happiest, strongest and most lively person in this room. What's your excuse?".<br><br>I have read a lot of books teaching various philosophies and ways to live life and be happy. I have always wanted to meet a "real" teacher. The one I can respect and look up to. The one that lived his teaching and not simply taught for the purpose of gaining money, fame or both.<br><br>A Buddhist proverb states: "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear".<br><br>Only after Alex's passing I realized that it is more about "student ready" rather than "teacher will appear". Teachers come in different shapes and sizes. Some are amazing enough to have two bellybuttons. <br><br>When one looks carefully and with his heart, he may be fortunate to meet a true "living master".</p>

<p class="memorial">Alex was the bravest, happiest, and smiliest little boy I've ever known. I feel blessed to have had him in my life. <br><br>His mom Terra has been my best friend for over 24 years and she is like another sister to me. I'm sadest of all for her, Andrew and Brooke.<br><br>Know that I love you all so much and that I will miss Alex always.</p>

<p class="memorial">"Daddy please don't look so sad, mommy please don't cry. <br>Cause I'm in the arms of Jesus, and he sings me lullabies. <br>Please try not to question God, don't think he is unkind. <br>Don't think he sent me to you and then changed his mind. <br>You see I'm a special child, I am needed up above. <br>I'm the special gift you gave Him, a product of your love. <br>I'll always be there with you, so watch the sky at night. <br>Look for the brightest star and know that's my halo's brilliant light. <br>You'll see me in the morning frost that mists your window pane. <br>That's me in the summer showers, I'll be dancing in the rain. <br>When you feel a gentle breeze from a gentle wind that blows. <br>Know that it's me planting a kiss upon your nose. <br>When you see a child playing and your heart feels a tug, <br>Don't be sad mommy, that's just me giving your heart a hug. <br>So daddy don't looks so sad and mommy please don't cry. <br>I'm in the arms of Jesus and he sings me lullabies!<br><br>There are no words to express how sorry we are for your loss.</p>

<p class="memorial">Hey Alex,<br><br>How are things in the beautiful clouds?<br><br>I'm sure as soon as you walked through those gates and met with the big man he handed you over the puppy you always wanted. What type was it Alex? One like Bella or a big guy like Dozer? Remember what we talked about...what it means if a seagull poops on Daddy's head. <br><br> Have you picked out your farm yet to live on? Remember I wanted you to pick out a horse for me. A big white one if possible please.<br><br>How's that big toy store in the sky? I'm sure you have gone on a shopping spree already and there is not one Cars toys, Wii games or DVDs left in that store.  <br><br>Are you ready for school? I bet you can start school at any time in Heaven. <br><br>Devyn says he knows you will give us these answers in our dreams. Liam thinks you will write them in the sky.<br><br>Well any ways Alex you know we all love you here and are thinking of you. We are sad and we will miss you a ton, but we also know that you are no longer suffering.<br><br>P.S. Please do not say to God: "Are you crazy??!!" : )</p>

<p class="memorial">Its so hard to say goodbye to someone not to mention someone so young, Alex you touched the hearts of so many your short time here on earth, through you I have learned to live life to the fullest, to make everyday count. No matter how ill you felt you always wore a smile on that handsome face of yours.<br><br>RIP little man XO<br><br></p>

<p class="memorial">A Story About Alex....<br> <br>I'm sure anyone who has seen my profile picture knows that my beloved grandfather died the other day, but that wasn't the only loss fate decided to pass along.  Twelve hours later, my little nephew Alex passed away from cancer.  I'm not going to complain about how unfair it is, or offer some "writer's version" of why it happened.  I don't understand and I never will.<br> <br>Alex was my stepbrother Andy's little boy, and although he and I didn't cross paths a ton of times during his few years, he certainly made an impression on me.  You see, Alex was in love with my daughter Olivia.  Liv is almost eleven now, over twice Alex's age....but that didn't seem to bother him too much.  <br> <br>He would talk about her and ask about her and hug her and snuggle with her whenever they would meet.  He spent a lot of time back and forth to hospitals for treatment, but anytime he happened upon Olivia, he was certainly smitten.<br> <br>The story I want to share is really a one-liner that I will definitely carry with me all the rest of my days.  I was visiting my Dad's house sometime within the past few months and Alex also happened to be there.<br> <br>We were playing around like any normal uncle and nephew would, when out of the blue and without hesitation he asked, "Do you know my wife, Olivia?"<br> <br>I guess because we hadn't spent tons of time together and because of his age, he hadn't really made the connection just yet.  I couldn't help but smile, and replied, "I certainly do know your wife Olivia!"<br> <br>We just continued playing with our cars or whatever we were throwing around, but the message was loud and clear, and it will bring a smile to my face every time it comes to mind.<br> <br>Alex....I know we didn't see an awful lot of each other and I know you had to leave, but I want to thank you for loving my baby like you did.  I know she appreciated it too!  <br>I have four daughters and I'm sure to see my share of son-in-laws in the years ahead, but I think it's safe to say that you'll always be my favourite ;)<br>Uncle Ken</p>

<p class="memorial">Our hearts go out to you and your family, I was only around Alex a few times but I enjoyed the energy and he always made me laugh.  May God's love lead you to the peace I know you must need right now.  Take care.</p>

<p class="memorial">Terra, my love and light will surround you and your family always. Please call whenever you are ready. I might not have the right words to say but we've walked similar paths and I feel your pain...I'm here to listen and to talk with.<br><br><br>I can just see our boys playing again, but now they are tube free and beaming with light. <br><br>Whenever I think of your warrior I think of that smile that filled the room with such light and his energy that radiated happiness. <br><br>Elena (Connor's Mommy)<br>xo</p>

<p class="memorial">We never got to know you Alex, but we wanted to. We met you in Montreal for the first time as we were preparing for Maya's MIBG therapy.<br><br>We are also devastated by your passing. Although we never got to know you, in some ways, you were also our child.  All neuroblastoma children belong to all neuroblastoma parents. <br><br>Regardless, I am grateful that you brought so much light and joy to this world. Another neuroblastoma mom said it the best; "He was worth the pain of losing him and she'd go through it again..." It's easy to see that you were worthy too.<br><br>Rest in Peace son.<br><br></p>

<p class="memorial">Dear Tara and Andrew We didn't get to see Alex much over the yrs. But we always thought of him, always wondered how he was and asked every time we saw Chad How is Alex? The news was always promising He's doing better, and finally, the words that made us so happy, he is in remission! Tara when I saw you recently his little face stayed in my mind for days and I was So happy for you and you looked happy as did he. Hearing the news was devastating for us I thought I just saw you he was fine. but I realized it was meant to be our chance encounter and I will always remember his smile that day. We were away and not able to attend his funeral but we thought of you the whole time we were away and we wanted you to know you will always be in our thoughts Love Joan Dan and Ella xoxo<br><br></p>

<p class="memorial">I will never forget Alex's smile or how many times him and Libby looked like an old married couple walking up and down that hall.  Alex was always fixing her car, filling it with gas, or walking beside her while they took the "baby" for a walk.  He's touched a lot of hearts.</p>

<p class="memorial">Dearest Terra &amp; Andy,<br>I was heartbroken when I heard about Alex. I can not, nor do I even want to try to imagine the pain you went through when he was called to Heaven...but your courage throughout his treatments is what amazes me the most! You are so strong Sweetie!<br>  I am sorry I never got a lot of time with him but he made me feel that I knew him forever...the smiles, the hugs and the laughter!<br>  Only you.. could have made him the most incredible child I have had the honor and privlege to meet.. the way he was!!! <br>  Heaven sent he was to a mother that is an Angel herself!<br>  God Bless you both!!<br>Love &amp; Hugs,<br>XX00   </p>
